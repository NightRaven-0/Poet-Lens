# PoetLens 

> "A picture is worth a thousand words... but like, what if it rhymed?"

PoetLens is a brainchild of coffee, boredom, and excessive exposure to both poetry and memes.  
It takes your boring ol' images and turns them into **deep, emotional, possibly unhinged poems** using AI magic.

## ðŸ’¡ What does it do?

1. You give it an image (yes, even your cat).
2. It stares into the soul of that image with a vision model called **BLIP**.
3. It turns the image into a caption like:  
   _"a lone toaster in a field under the moonlight"_
4. It sends that caption to a large language model (LLM) like GPT and says,  
   **"Turn this into ART."**
5. BAM. You get a poem. Possibly too deep for Instagram.
